Aaron mubanga is my name and being the subject of discussion is something I luck interest in.  
For that reason I tend to preach of areas of my life that few to nobody are interested in knowing. But I will
add some affort this time.

I am a lad native to Zambia, born and raised in lusaka. I completed my grade 12 in the year 2015, had a short 
plumbing course 3 years later, worked with a marchendizing company for a month and finally went to collage
the year that followed, a 3 years program in water engineering.
 
Along the way to aquiring my deploma, I developed an interest in code thanks to a brother of mine and our 
friend. And upon completion, I was mate by the Dufuna program  

The unprofessional side of me life is of a boy that gruw in a world comprissing of this nuclear family
and school mates/the sfaff. Nothing amazing and really needing on the social life angle. But none the less
I am here and ready to work for the promise of a better tomorrow. 

this is just for test.
